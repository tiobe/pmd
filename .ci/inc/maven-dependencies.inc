# Usually, you can configure wagon with ttl. But these settings are
# ignored, as soon as dokka-maven-plugin is loaded.
# dokka-maven-plugin tries to load additional dependencies at runtime
# and injects a different http client, which is not configured correctly
# and thus maven fails if it tries to download later in the build process
# further dependencies.
#
# The workaround applied here is: first resolve all dependencies,
# then explicitly get dokka-maven-plugin and then resolve all plugins
# execpt for dokka-maven-plugin, as it does not play well with dependency-plugin.
