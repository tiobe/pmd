### New and noteworthy

#### Java 14 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 14. PMD can parse [Switch Expressions](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/361),
which have been promoted to be a standard language feature of Java.

PMD also parses [Text Blocks](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/368) as String literals, which is still a preview
language feature in Java 14.

The new [Pattern Matching for instanceof](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305) can be used as well as
[Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359).

Note: The Text Blocks, Pattern Matching for instanceof and Records are all preview language features of OpenJDK 14
and are not enabled by default. In order to
analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features, you'll need to enable it via the environment
variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language version `14-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    ./run.sh pmd -language java -version 14-preview ...

Note: Support for the extended break statement introduced in Java 12 as a preview language feature
has been removed from PMD with this version. The version "12-preview" is no longer available.


#### Updated PMD Designer

This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.
For the changes, see [PMD Designer Changelog](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/6.21.0).

#### Apex Suppressions

In addition to suppressing violation with the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation, Apex now also supports
the suppressions with a `NOPMD` comment. See [Suppressing warnings](pmd_userdocs_suppressing_warnings.html).

#### Improved CPD support for C#

The C# tokenizer is now based on an antlr grammar instead of a manual written tokenizer. This
should give more accurate results and especially fixes the problems with the using statement syntax
(see [#2139](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2139)).

#### XPath Rules

See the new documentation about [Writing XPath Rules](pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_xpath_rules.html).

*Note:* As of PMD version 6.22.0, XPath versions 1.0 and the 1.0 compatibility mode are **deprecated**.
XPath 2.0 is superior in many ways, for example for its support for type checking, sequence values,
or quantified expressions. For a detailed but approachable review of the features of XPath 2.0 and above,
see the [Saxon documentation](https://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!expressions).

#### New Rules

*   The Rule {% rule "apex/design/CognitiveComplexity" %} (`apex-design`) finds methods and classes
    that are highly complex and therefore difficult to read and more costly to maintain. In contrast
    to cyclomatic complexity, this rule uses "Cognitive Complexity", which is a measure of how
    difficult it is for humans to read and understand a method.

*   The Rule {% rule "apex/errorprone/TestMethodsMustBeInTestClasses" %} (`apex-errorprone`) finds test methods
    that are not residing in a test class. The test methods should be moved to a proper test class.
    Support for tests inside functional classes was removed in Spring-13 (API Version 27.0), making classes
    that violate this rule fail compile-time. This rule is however useful when dealing with legacy code.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

##### Internal API

Those APIs are not intended to be used by clients, and will be hidden or removed with PMD 7.0.0.
You can identify them with the `@InternalApi` annotation. You'll also get a deprecation warning.

* {% jdoc java::lang.java.JavaLanguageHandler %}
* {% jdoc java::lang.java.JavaLanguageParser %}
* {% jdoc java::lang.java.JavaDataFlowHandler %}
* Implementations of {% jdoc core::lang.rule.RuleViolationFactory %} in each
  language module, eg {% jdoc java::lang.java.rule.JavaRuleViolationFactory %}.
  See javadoc of {% jdoc core::lang.rule.RuleViolationFactory %}.
* Implementations of {% jdoc core::RuleViolation %} in each language module,
  eg {% jdoc java::lang.java.rule.JavaRuleViolation %}. See javadoc of
  {% jdoc core::RuleViolation %}.

* {% jdoc core::rules.RuleFactory %}
* {% jdoc core::rules.RuleBuilder %}
* Constructors of {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactory %}, use factory methods from {% jdoc core::RulesetsFactoryUtils %} instead
* {% jdoc core::RulesetsFactoryUtils#getRulesetFactory(core::PMDConfiguration, core::util.ResourceLoader) %}

* {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.AbstractApexNode %}
* {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.AbstractApexNodeBase %}, and the related `visit`
methods on {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.ApexParserVisitor %} and its implementations.
 Use {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.ast.ApexNode %} instead, now considers comments too.

##### For removal

* pmd-core
  * {% jdoc core::lang.dfa.DFAGraphRule %} and its implementations
  * {% jdoc core::lang.dfa.DFAGraphMethod %}
  * Many methods on the {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %} interface
  and {% jdoc core::lang.ast.AbstractNode %} base class. See their javadoc for details.
  * {% jdoc !!core::lang.ast.Node#isFindBoundary() %} is deprecated for XPath queries.
  * Many APIs of {% jdoc_package core::lang.metrics %}, though most of them were internal and
  probably not used directly outside of PMD. Use {% jdoc core::lang.metrics.MetricsUtil %} as
  a replacement for the language-specific fa√ßades too.
  * {% jdoc core::lang.ast.QualifiableNode %}, {% jdoc core::lang.ast.QualifiedName %}
* pmd-java
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.AbstractJavaParser %}
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.AbstractJavaHandler %}
  * [`ASTAnyTypeDeclaration.TypeKind`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.21.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTAnyTypeDeclaration.TypeKind.html)
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTAnyTypeDeclaration#getKind() %}
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.JavaQualifiedName %}
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTCatchStatement#getBlock() %}
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTCompilationUnit#declarationsAreInDefaultPackage() %}
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.JavaQualifiableNode %}
    * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTAnyTypeDeclaration#getQualifiedName() %}
    * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTMethodOrConstructorDeclaration#getQualifiedName() %}
    * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTLambdaExpression#getQualifiedName() %}
  * {% jdoc_package java::lang.java.qname %} and its contents
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.MethodLikeNode %}
    * Its methods will also be removed from its implementations,
      {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTMethodOrConstructorDeclaration %},
      {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTLambdaExpression %}.
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTAnyTypeDeclaration#getImage() %} will be removed. Please use `getSimpleName()`
    instead. This affects {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTAnnotationTypeDeclaration#getImage() %},
    {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration#getImage() %}, and
    {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTEnumDeclaration#getImage() %}.
  * Several methods of {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTTryStatement %}, replacements with other names
    have been added. This includes the XPath attribute `@Finally`, replace it with a test for `child::FinallyStatement`.
  * Several methods named `getGuardExpressionNode` are replaced with `getCondition`. This affects the
    following nodes: WhileStatement, DoStatement, ForStatement, IfStatement, AssertStatement, ConditionalExpression.
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTYieldStatement %} will not implement {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.TypeNode %}
    anymore come 7.0.0. Test the type of the expression nested within it.
  * {% jdoc java::lang.java.metrics.JavaMetrics %}, {% jdoc java::lang.java.metrics.JavaMetricsComputer %}
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTArguments#getArgumentCount() %}.
    Use {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTArguments#size() %} instead.
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTFormalParameters#getParameterCount() %}.
    Use {% jdoc java::lang.java.ast.ASTFormalParameters#size() %} instead.
* pmd-apex
  * {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.metrics.ApexMetrics %}, {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.metrics.ApexMetricsComputer %}

##### In ASTs (JSP)

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the JSP AST** (with other languages to come):

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,
    which for rules, means that they never need to instantiate node themselves.
    Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
    *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc jsp::lang.jsp.ast.JspNode %} or
        {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package,
        to refer to nodes generically.
    *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The class {% jdoc jsp::lang.jsp.JspParser %} is deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use {% jdoc !!core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler#getParser(ParserOptions) %} instead.

Please look at {% jdoc_package jsp::lang.jsp.ast %} to find out the full list of deprecations.

##### In ASTs (Velocity)

As part of the changes we'd like to do to AST classes for 7.0.0, we would like to
hide some methods and constructors that rule writers should not have access to.
The following usages are now deprecated **in the VM AST** (with other languages to come):

*   Manual instantiation of nodes. **Constructors of node classes are deprecated** and
    marked {% jdoc core::annotation.InternalApi %}. Nodes should only be obtained from the parser,
    which for rules, means that they never need to instantiate node themselves.
    Those constructors will be made package private with 7.0.0.
*   **Subclassing of abstract node classes, or usage of their type**. The base classes are internal API
    and will be hidden in version 7.0.0. You should not couple your code to them.
    *   In the meantime you should use interfaces like {% jdoc vm::lang.vm.ast.VmNode %} or
        {% jdoc core::lang.ast.Node %}, or the other published interfaces in this package,
        to refer to nodes generically.
    *   Concrete node classes will **be made final** with 7.0.0.
*   Setters found in any node class or interface. **Rules should consider the AST immutable**.
    We will make those setters package private with 7.0.0.
*   The package {% jdoc_package vm::lang.vm.directive %} as well as the classes
    {% jdoc vm::lang.vm.util.DirectiveMapper %} and {% jdoc vm::lang.vm.util.LogUtil %} are deprecated
    for removal. They were only used internally during parsing.
*   The class {% jdoc vm::lang.vm.VmParser %} is deprecated and should not be used directly.
    Use {% jdoc !!core::lang.LanguageVersionHandler#getParser(ParserOptions) %} instead.

Please look at {% jdoc_package vm::lang.vm.ast %} to find out the full list of deprecations.

#### PLSQL AST

The production and node `ASTCursorBody` was unnecessary, not used and has been removed. Cursors have been already
parsed as `ASTCursorSpecification`.
