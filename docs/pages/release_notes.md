### New and noteworthy

#### Updated Apex Support

*   The Apex language support has been bumped to version 50 (Winter '21). All new language features are now properly
    parsed and processed. Especially the [Safe Navigation Operator](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/rn_apex_SafeNavigationOperator.htm) is now supported.
    See also [Salesforce Winter '21 Release Notes](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter21/release-notes/rn_apex.htm)

#### New Rules

*   The new Apex rule {% rule "apex/performance/OperationWithLimitsInLoop" %} (`apex-performance`)
    finds operations in loops that may hit governor limits such as DML operations, SOQL
    queries and more. The rule replaces the three rules "AvoidDmlStatementsInLoops", "AvoidSoqlInLoops",
    and "AvoidSoslInLoops".

#### Renamed Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/DoNotCallSystemExit" %} has been renamed to
    {% rule "java/errorprone/DoNotTerminateVM" %}, since it checks for all the following calls:
    `System.exit(int)`, `Runtime.exit(int)`, `Runtime.halt(int)`. All these calls terminate
    the Java VM, which is bad, if the VM runs an application server which many independent applications.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Apex rules {% rule "apex/performance/AvoidDmlStatementsInLoops" %},
    {% rule "apex/performance/AvoidSoqlInLoops" %} and {% rule "apex/performance/AvoidSoslInLoops" %}
    (`apex-performance`) are deprecated in favour of the new rule
    {% rule "apex/performance/OperationWithLimitsInLoop" %}. The deprecated rules will be removed
    with PMD 7.0.0.
